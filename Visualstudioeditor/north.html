<p>The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[26] Nearly  contemporaneous human rock art sites have been 
    found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, 
    construction of permanent structures, and storage of  agricultural surplus, appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[28]  hese gradually developed into the Indus Valley
    Civilisation,[29][28] the first urban culture in South Asia,[30] which flourished during 2500â€“1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western   India.[31] Centred around cities such as
    Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilization engaged robustly in  crafts
    roduction and wide-ranging trade.[30]
